## Contribution Tasks

* Reviewing and Merging Changes

### Reviewing and Merging Changes

1. Approval Required - Github enforces at least one person approve a pull request.
2. Required Labels - an appropriate [semver](https://semver.org/) label (see [release.yml](https://github.com/samvera/hyku/blob/main/.github/release.yml))

If one or more of the required checks failed (or are incomplete), the code should not be merged (and the UI will not allow it). If all of the checks have passed, then anyone on the project (preferably the pull request submitter) may merge the code.
